            <h2>Childhood Years</h2>
            <p>
                <sub>1</sub>I grew up in <strong>Quezon City</strong>, a place filled with busy streets and warm memories.
                <sub>2</sub>I remember having a play friend who came over almost every afternoon.
                <sub>3</sub>We always met from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m., which became the <strong>happiest hours of my childhood</strong>.
                <sub>4</sub>We played outside endlessly as if time did not exist.
                <sub>5</sub>Those moments made me feel free and excited every day.
                <sub>6</sub>Even though I enjoyed playing, I was the kind of kid who cried easily.
                <sub>7</sub>Whenever someone bullied me, tears would come before I could stop them.
                <sub>8</sub>I always tried to fight back, but I still ended up crying in the end.
                <sub>9</sub>Despite that, those experiences helped me <strong>understand my emotions early on</strong>.
                <sub>10</sub>My childhood also came with family issues that shaped me in difficult ways.
                <sub>11</sub>Those challenges forced me to grow up faster than I expected.
                <sub>12</sub>They taught me that <strong>life is not always simple or kind</strong>.
                <sub>13</sub>Still, I found comfort in small joys around me.
                <sub>14</sub>I loved the afternoons that felt peaceful and full of laughter.
                <sub>15</sub>I learned to appreciate the people who stayed by my side.
                <sub>16</sub>My neighborhood became a part of my identity.
                <sub>17</sub>The streets I played on became symbols of both happiness and struggle.
                <sub>18</sub>My childhood shaped the sensitivity I carry today.
                <sub>19</sub>It also built the <strong>strength I continue to develop</strong>.
                <sub>20</sub>Looking back, those early years form a story I will always carry with me.

            <h2>Teenage Years</h2>
            <p>
                <sub>1</sub>My teenage years began when I entered <strong>Quezon City Academy</strong> in Grade 7.

                <sub>3</sub>School life was often hectic and filled with assignments, deadlines, and responsibilities.

                <sub>14</sub>Not everything was easy, but effort always mattered.
                <sub>15</sub>Those years were far from perfect, yet they strengthened me.
                <sub>16</sub>They <strong>shaped my identity</strong> and prepared me for the next chapter of my life.
