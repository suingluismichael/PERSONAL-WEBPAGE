  <h2>Love is what I yearned for</h2>

  <p>
    I never thought that love made me yearn on about it, just to feel that <strong>effortless bare minimum</strong>, moments that is being shared, seeking comfort, and etc. It made me believed that by having this kind of love, makes me the one to be <em>"the winner takes it all"</em>.
    I trusted the feeling completely, letting myself fall without hesitation. Love felt like a promise, and I held onto it with certainty, unaware that it would soon ask more of me than I was prepared to give.

  <h2>Where Loving Meant Losing</h2>
  <p>
    Throughout the relationship that I have been, I had a realization that whenever I love someone, is the cost of <strong>losing myself</strong> for them just to be dependent, and vulnerable to them. As part of myself to love somebody, is what I give them a 100% to give them the love they deserve, instead, I became a stranger to my own needs. I stopped pursuing my own passions and silenced my own voice, all to keep the peace and ensure they felt whole. It took me a long time to see that <em>I couldn't truly love someone if I had completely abandoned myself</em>. Loving someone shouldn't have meant losing my identity—it should have meant finding someone who <strong>respected the person I already am</strong>.

  <h2>When Love Cost Me Peace</h2>
  <p>
    I finally realized that true love shouldn't feel like a constant battle to stay afloat. For a long time, I thought love was meant to be intense and draining, but I’ve learned that the best kind of love is actually <strong>quiet</strong>. It’s the kind that brings me <em>peace of mind rather than constant anxiety</em>. I stopped looking for the "spark" that keeps me on edge and started looking for the <strong>"calm"</strong> that lets me sleep at night. Now understand that the cost of a relationship is just too great if it compromises my sense of self or mental well-being. Real love is a place where I finally feel whole and at peace; it doesn't require me to lose myself.
