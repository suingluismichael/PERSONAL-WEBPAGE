  <h2>Finding My Direction Through the Stars</h2>
  <p>
    I became interested in <strong>astronomy</strong> because I was curious about space and how the universe works. 
    I often looked at the night sky and asked questions about stars and planets. Over time, this interest 
    became something more serious. I realized that learning about astronomy made me motivated to study 
    and improve myself. It helped me understand that there is a <em>wide world beyond what we see every day</em>. 
    This interest made me think about my future and the kind of career I want to pursue.

  <h2>Choosing a Path That Truly Matters to Me</h2>

<p>
  As I reached the point where I had to choose a college course, my interest in astronomy was still guiding my thoughts about the future. I knew I wanted a path that would not only challenge me but also help me grow, so I chose <strong>Information Technology</strong>. I was already comfortable working with computers and enjoyed solving problems, which made IT feel like a natural choice. As I continued learning, I realized that the skills I gain in IT—such as <strong>programming, logical thinking, and understanding technology</strong>—can support my dream of studying astronomy. Instead of leaving my passion behind, I found a way to move closer to it through a <em>practical and meaningful path</em>.

<ul>
  <li>Continued interest in <strong>astronomy as a guiding passion</strong></li>
  <li>Choosing Information Technology as a <strong>practical college course</strong></li>
  <li>Confidence in working with computers and technology</li>
  <li>Building skills in <em>programming, hardware, and logical thinking</em></li>
  <li>Using IT knowledge to support future goals in astronomy and data analysis</li>
</ul>
  <p>
    When I started choosing a course for college, my interest in astronomy was still clear to me. 
    I decided to take Information Technology not only because it is in demand, but because it is 
    something I am capable of learning and understanding. I am familiar with computers and I enjoy 
    working with technology and solving problems. Studying IT helps me develop skills such as <strong>programming, 
    hardware peripherals, and logical thinking</strong>. These skills can support my long-term goal of studying 
    astronomy, especially in areas that rely on technology and data analysis. By choosing IT, I am taking 
    a practical step while still working toward my passion for astronomy.

  <h2>My Future Career</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Importance of <strong>self-understanding</strong> in career decisions</li>
    <li>Balancing passion (astronomy) with practical skills (IT)</li>
    <li>Learning that career choices require <em>effort and commitment</em></li>
    <li>Aligning personal interests with abilities</li>
    <li>Plans to continuously improve IT skills while pursuing astronomy</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Looking back at my choices, I realized that understanding myself is important when deciding on a career. 
    My interest in astronomy continues to guide my long-term goal, while taking Information Technology helps 
    me build practical skills that I can use along the way. I learned that choosing a career is not only 
    about what is in demand, but also about what I am capable of and willing to work hard for. My takeaway 
    is that <strong>growth comes from aligning passion with ability</strong>. Moving forward, I plan to continue improving 
    my IT skills while keeping my focus on astronomy, knowing that both can support my future. This path 
    gives me confidence and direction as I work toward my career goals.
