    <h2>How Technology evolve over-time</h2>
    <p>As technology evolves over the years, we humans, have always looked for better ways to interact with computers.
        From the early days of using manual-punch cards and less digital interaction back in the day, up until to today's <strong>touchscreens and voice recognition</strong>, 
        the development of <strong>human-computer interaction (HCI)</strong> has finally come from a wish to make technology more <em>accessible, intuitive, and efficient</em>. 
        It's not just about making things look good, it's about how efficient and helpful for us to improve
        our daily lives by the use of technology. Each day of what we are doing, technology is there to help us in one way or another.

    <h2>Growing up through the age of technology</h2>
    <p>I remember when I was a child, the first computer that I used was the <strong>Windows 7</strong> back then. 
        I was so fascinated when we really have a computer at that time, and got mesmerized by the colorful icons and some other cool features like games. 
        I spent hours playing games like <em>Plant VS. Zombie, Y8, Friv</em> and other game features and applications. It was the best experience for me as a child to have
        one of those computers at home, and good thing that internet was introduced, as far I remember, all of us keeps fighting on how slow the internet when someone is downloading a file, or watching a youtube. As I grew older, I started to go on to a various different computer-shop nearby in my place, just to play a good quality games
        with a great performanace. I remember going to the computer shop with my friends, and we would spend hours playing games like <strong>Roblox, Minecraft</strong>, and other popular games at that time. By using some various technologies, I can truly say that, technology has been a part from me since the day I started to use it. With that, I can easily, and know the difference without making myself confused of what technology I can perceive.

    <h2>Technology shaped my knowledge to reflect</h2>
    <p>My knowledge and learning experiences have also been greatly influenced by technology. 
        I've had access to a lot of information over the years using different technologies thanks to the <strong>development of the internet</strong>. 
        I also watch educational videos about different technologies on platforms like <em>YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok</em>. With them, I understand on how technologies work and how they can be used in our daily lives.
        This has made it possible for me to keep up with the most recent upgraded peripherals in technology and has significantly improved my comprehension of various subjects. With that, there are other things that technology can be reflected who I am today, especially whenever I use them for good or bad to a different situation. Even I know to myself what is right or wrong, <strong>reflecting oneself makes the usage of technology be more practical.</strong>
